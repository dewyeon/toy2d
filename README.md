## Introduction
The trend in normalizing flow (NF) literature has been to devise deeper, more complex transformations to achieve greater flexibility.

We propose an alternative: Gradient Boosted Normalizing Flows (GBNF) model a density by successively adding new NF components with gradient boosting. Under the boosting framework, each new NF component optimizes a sample weighted likelihood objective, resulting in new components that are fit to the residuals of the previously trained components.

The GBNF formulation results in a mixture model structure, whose flexibility increases as more components are added. Moreover, GBNFs offer a wider, as opposed to strictly deeper, approach that improves existing NFs at the cost of additional training---not more complex transformations.

## Requirements
The code is compatible with:

  * `pytorch 1.1.0`
  * `python 3.6+` (should work fine with python 2.7 though if you include print_function)

It is recommended that you create a virtual environment with the correct
python version and dependencies. After cloning the repository, change directories
and run the following codes to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(code assumes `python` refers to python 3.6+, if not use `python3`)


## Data
The experiments can be run on the following images datasets:


* static MNIST: dataset is in data folder;
* OMNIGLOT: the dataset can be downloaded from [link](https://github.com/yburda/iwae/blob/master/datasets/OMNIGLOT/chardata.mat);
* Caltech 101 Silhouettes: the dataset can be downloaded from [link](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~marlin/data/caltech101_silhouettes_28_split1.mat).
* Frey Faces: the dataset can be downloaded from [link](https://github.com/y0ast/Variational-Autoencoder/blob/master/freyfaces.pkl).
* CIFAR10: from Torchvision library
* CelebA: from Torchvision library

Additionally, density estimation experiments can be run on datasets from the UCI repository, which can be downloaded by:

```
./download_datasets.sh
```
